											<h2>2017 crypto boom</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Dogecoin’s first major pump started around March 10, 2017, as a significant rise in retail investment 
											started to pour into the crypto market for the first time, lifting all alternative coins, or altcoins. 
											Over 70 days, the “joke” cryptocurrency rose by more than 1,890% from $0.00021 to a peak of $0.0042 on May 21. 
											This shattered the previous all-time high of $0.0021 and sent the market cap soaring over $423 million. 
											Shortly after, dogecoin (DOGE, +2.02%) slumped 75% during a two-week market pullback that affected all cryptocurrencies.</p>

										<h3>Bitcoin breaks $19,783, lifts dogecoin</h3>
										<p>The first major dogecoin rally that was largely uncorrelated to the rest of the crypto market was in September 2018
											when a system test of the Dogecoin/Ethereum bridge was completed. <br>
										The bridge was supposed to be a new update that would allow interoperability between the two blockchains. The announcement 
											reignited community support for the project and dogecoin’s price rose 173% in 48 hours.<br>
										It later transpired, however, that due to a crash in the price of ether – the main cryptocurrency of the Ethereum project
											– there was insufficient funding to continue developing the bridge and the update was put on hold. Since then, there
											has been no mention of whether this bridge between Dogecoin and Ethereum will ever be continued.  </p>

										<h3>WallStreetBets mania, Elon Musk tweet</h3>
										<p>On Jan. 11, 2021, the traditional financial markets were heavily disrupted by a subreddit group called the WallStreetBets
											(aka WSB). These amateur stock traders decided to unite against traditional financial institutions and pump a number of 
											stocks that major hedge funds were betting on falling in value, such as GameStop, BlackBerry, AMC, Nokia and Bed Bath & Beyond.<br>
										On Jan. 28, the WSB stock market mania spilled across to dogecoin and catalyzed the biggest crypto rally of the year so far. In less than
											two days, dogecoin skyrocketed to a new all-time high of $0.087 on the Binance exchange – representing a 1,100% gain. The rally was 
											fueled in part by a number of tweets, including one from Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and avid dogecoin fan. <br>
										Netflix’s “Tiger King” celebrity, Carole Baskin, also tweeted a video voicing her support for the dog-themed cryptocurrency.  </p>
